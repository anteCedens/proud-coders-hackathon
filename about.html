        <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Solace in Colour was launched in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic. This last year has been a turbulent one for many. The loss of exhibitions, gallery openings, concerts, shows, performances, book clubs and so much more, has highlighted how important art and interaction is to us as humans. 
            At Solace in Colour we want to bring together a community of people that want to explore LGBTQ+ artists and engage together through an online platform. We seek to showcase LGBTQ+ artists’ and supporters perspectives, stories, and identities. Solace in Colour provides an opportunity for the voice of a population that has been historically suppressed, disenfranchised, and often overlooked.
           We established this site to create a space whereby people can explore different art forms produced by people who are LGBTQ+. We believe that by creating this online platform, we can encourage and promote discussion, provide an opportunity for people to engage and interact with others and showcase LGBTQ+ artists.  
        </p>

       <h2>Our Values</h2>
        <p> Solace in Colour strives to be inclusive to all that want to participate and to be wholly accepting and welcoming. We believe that freedom of expression is so important to us as individuals but also important for the LGBTQ+ community. 
            We believe that everyone has a right to be themselves and feel safe to do so. Here at Solace in Colour, we do not tolerate derogatory, prejudice or hateful language or behaviour. We ask that all our friends, members and participants be respectful to one another.
        </p>

       <h2>Our Community</h2>
        <p> At Solace in Colour, we believe that projects, such as our own, do not operate successfully in isolation. We are strong advocates of colloaborative working, building relations and working with communities.
