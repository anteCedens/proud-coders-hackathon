# Solace in Colour

Solace in Colour is an online platform that positively promotes art, music and literature created by people who are LGBTQ+. The aim of this site is to produce an inclusive and safe environment that encourages healthy, meaningful dialogue. We want this site to showcase the talent and ability of artists who are LGBTQ+. This site has been created with inclusion and community at the heart of it, so it is open to everyone who wants to explore LGBTQ+ artists.

This site was developed as part of Code Institute's Pride Hackathon.
